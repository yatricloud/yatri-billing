# Yatri Billing Website Redesign Prompt

Use this prompt to redesign the `landing/` website for Yatri Billing.

You are a senior product designer, frontend engineer, technical SEO strategist, AEO/GEO content strategist, and conversion-rate optimization specialist.

Redesign the Yatri Billing website as a modern, professional, fast, accessible, SEO-optimized static website using only plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Do not use React, Vue, Angular, Tailwind, Bootstrap, jQuery, icon-font frameworks, Swiper, or any other frontend framework. The final output must be deployable on GitHub Pages as static files.

Preserve all important existing content, SEO value, page URLs, canonical URLs, schema intent, and download functionality. Improve layout, visual polish, speed, accessibility, and search/answer visibility.

## Technical Requirements

Build with:

- Semantic HTML5
- One clean global CSS file
- Vanilla JavaScript only where interaction is necessary
- Static assets only
- No build step required
- No external UI frameworks
- No external icon fonts
- No decorative JavaScript animation libraries
- No heavy sliders or third-party UI dependencies

Use inline SVG icons or simple CSS icons where needed. Keep JavaScript small, readable, and progressive-enhancement friendly.

The site must work when hosted on GitHub Pages and must not require a server, bundler, Node runtime, or API proxy.

## Design Direction

Create a modern SaaS-quality product website, but avoid generic startup sameness. The visual design should feel trustworthy, practical, and professional for business owners who need billing software.

Design principles:

- Clean, premium, modern interface
- Strong first impression above the fold
- Clear product screenshots in the first viewport or immediately after it
- Better use of real app screenshots instead of abstract decoration
- Dense but readable business-focused sections
- Professional color palette with strong contrast
- Avoid overusing dark blue, purple gradients, glassmorphism, floating orb backgrounds, and generic decorative blobs
- Avoid nested cards and excessive card-heavy layouts
- Keep page sections full-width and structured
- Make calls to action obvious: "Download Free", "Try Invoice Maker", "View Source on GitHub"
- Make trust signals visible: open source, offline, no login, no subscription, local data, GitHub, latest release, platforms

The homepage should immediately answer:

- What is Yatri Billing?
- Who is it for?
- Why is it free?
- Does it work offline?
- Does it support GST invoices?
- Can I download it for my computer?
- Why trust it?

- Where is invoice data stored?
- Which platforms does Yatri Billing support?
- Is Yatri Billing a Vyapar alternative?
- Can I create PDF invoices?

Use short, factual, self-contained answers in visible content, not only schema.

Add or preserve structured data:

- `WebSite`
- `WebPage`
- `Organization`
- `SoftwareApplication`
- `SoftwareSourceCode`
- `FAQPage`
- `BreadcrumbList` on internal pages

For GEO, make the site easy for generative search systems to cite:

- Clear product definition near the top

- Strong entity signals for Yatri Billing, author, GitHub repository, product category, operating systems, license, and domain

Also include geographic/local relevance for India where accurate:

- GST-ready invoices
- GSTIN and HSN fields
- UPI QR support
- Indian small businesses, freelancers, shops, traders, wholesalers, service businesses
- Do not create fake city pages or claim city-specific presence unless real

## Performance Requirements

Target Core Web Vitals:

- LCP under 2.5 seconds on mobile
- CLS under 0.1
- INP under 200 ms
- Lighthouse Performance 90+
- Lighthouse Accessibility 95+
- Lighthouse SEO 95+

Implementation requirements:

- Use optimized WebP/PNG screenshots with width and height attributes

- Preload only the most important hero image if needed
- Avoid render-blocking third-party CSS/JS
- Avoid loading YouTube iframe until user interaction
- Replace icon fonts with inline SVG or local icons
- Avoid large carousel libraries
- Use system fonts or self-hosted fonts with `font-display: swap`
- Minimize unused CSS

## Accessibility Requirements

- Visible focus states
- Sufficient color contrast
- Descriptive link text
- Descriptive image alt text
- ARIA only where necessary
- Accessible mobile navigation
- Accessible FAQ accordions

## Page-Specific Requirements

### `index.html`

Make this the strongest SEO and conversion page. It should sell Yatri Billing clearly, show the product, answer objections, and guide users to download.

### `download.html`

Keep dynamic GitHub release fetching if it currently works, but make the page graceful when the GitHub API fails. Show fallback links to GitHub Releases. Keep platform-specific download sections for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### `faq.html`

Use clean categories:

- General
- Pricing and open source
- Offline and privacy
- GST and India
- Features
- Downloads and platforms
- Technical/support

Each answer should be concise, factual, and link to relevant pages.

### `invoice-maker.html`

Keep it as a practical free invoice generator page. Optimize for `free invoice generator`, `GST invoice generator`, and `create PDF invoice`.

### `customization.html`

Keep the request/customisation page professional. Position it as paid custom development or custom feature requests if that is the intended business model. Do not let it distract from the free product positioning.

### `changelog.html`

Keep release history crawlable and user-readable. Link it from download and footer.

## Content Rules

Use clear, business-friendly language. Avoid hype.

Do not claim features that are not supported. Specifically avoid unsupported claims about:

- Full accounting
- Inventory accounting
- E-way bill
- E-invoice
- WhatsApp automation
- Barcode scanning
- Cloud sync
- Team collaboration beyond existing role-based local users
- Mobile apps
- Official GST filing

Use "GST-ready" rather than "GST-compliant" unless compliance is verified.

Use "free and open source" only if the app remains free and source code/license are public.

Produce a complete redesigned static website:

- Updated `index.html`
- Updated `download.html`
- Updated `faq.html`

- Updated `404.html` if needed
- Updated `style.css`

Also provide:
